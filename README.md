Hi there. I created this during the full day of Saturday, 12-5-15, as a project displaying some of my experience with html, css, and nodeJS.

The most challenging part of this project for me was using expressJS to handle the routing of XMLHttpRequests I was making to the node server. It was my first time using Express and, really, my first time setting up a server and router system without any pre-written code fragments as a guide. I primarily used ExpressJS's official documentation, a bunch of debugging, and number of web searches to figure it all out.

Enjoy!
